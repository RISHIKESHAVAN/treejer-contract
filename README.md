Treejer Protocol Smart Contracts is a lightweight implementation of the [Treejer Protocol](treejer.com) on Polygon.

In-depth documentation on Treejer protocol and the latest deployed contracts addresses are available at [Treejer Docs](https://docs.treejer.com/smart-contracts).

Visit [Treejer Blog](http://blog.treejer.com) for more details into the Treejer and how it works.

## Local Development

The following assumes the use of `node@>=13`.

### Install Dependencies

`npm install`

### Start Ganache

`npm run ganache`

### Test

`npm run test`

### Deploy on local ganache

`npm run deploy`

### Development using Docker

In order to facilitate better development and testing, the project has been integrated with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). This eliminates the necessity to setup the environment in your local machine. Simply spin up the `container` and start developing and testing in it.

**Requirements**
- `Docker` - If you don't have Docker installed in your local machine, you can get it by following the steps [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). This should also install `docker-compose`.

**Setup**

Two modes can be enabled via docker:
- _Development_: This creates a `container` with the project and all the dependencies installed in it. The project location in your local machine will be linked as a [volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) to the container and any edits you make in your local would be synced to the container. To spin up the development container use: `docker-compose up develop`
- _Testing_: This brings up a container and runs all the tests in it automatically and can be used purely for testing purposes. To spin up a testing container use: `docker-compose up test`
